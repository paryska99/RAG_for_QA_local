# RAG_for_QA_local

Enhanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for Question Answering: Dive into a hands-on implementation that leverages only local components, bypassing costly APIs. This robust example demonstrates the power of Langchain, an on-premises LLM, and a Vector Database. Highlights include crafting bespoke prompts, leveraging Sentence Transformers to tap into a plethora of Data Embedding models, and designing your unique tool tailored for seamless integration with Langchain Agents.
